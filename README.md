# ImageNet_Labels
Extracting the ImageNet pretrained model labels

Well for a class project, I needed to print all the classes of the ImageNet and all the solutions in the internet refered to a solution and githunb link that was removed.
Anyway, I used this method to print all the class labels and put them in a text file to make them easier to read.
